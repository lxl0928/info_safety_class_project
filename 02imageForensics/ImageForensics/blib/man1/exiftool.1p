.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
A command-line interface to Image::ExifTool, used for
reading and writing meta information in a variety of file types.  \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR is
one or more source file names, directory names, or \f(CW\*(C`\-\*(C'\fR for the standard
input.  Metadata is read from source files and printed in readable form
to the console (or written to output text files with \fB\-w\fR).
.PP
To write or delete metadata, tag values are assigned using the
\&\-\fI\s-1TAG\s0\fR=[\fI\s-1VALUE\s0\fR] syntax, or the \fB\-geotag\fR option.  To copy or move
metadata, the \fB\-tagsFromFile\fR feature is used.  By default the original
files are preserved with \f(CW\*(C`_original\*(C'\fR appended to their names \*(-- be sure to
verify that the new files are \s-1OK\s0 before erasing the originals.  Once in
write mode, exiftool will ignore any read-specific options.
.PP
Note:  If \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR is a directory name then only supported file types in the
directory are processed (in write mode only writable types are processed).
However, files may be specified by name, or the \fB\-ext\fR option may be used
to force processing of files with any extension.  Hidden files in the
directory are also processed.  Adding the \fB\-r\fR option causes subdirectories
to be processed recursively, but those with names beginning with \*(L".\*(R" are
skipped unless \fB\-r.\fR is used.
.PP
Below is a list of file types and meta information formats currently
supported by ExifTool (r = read, w = write, c = create):

Case is not significant for any command-line option (including tag and group
names), except for single-character options when the corresponding
upper-case option exists.  Many single-character options have equivalent
long-name versions (shown in brackets), and some options have inverses which
are invoked with a leading double-dash.  Unrecognized options are
interpreted as tag names (for this reason, multiple single-character options
may \s-1NOT\s0 be combined into one argument).  Contrary to standard practice,
options may appear after source file names on the exiftool command line.

Extract information for the specified tag (eg. \f(CW\*(C`\-CreateDate\*(C'\fR).  Multiple
tags may be specified in a single command.  A tag name is the handle by
which a piece of information is referenced.  See
Image::ExifTool::TagNames for documentation on
available tag names.  A tag name may include leading group names separated
by colons (eg. \f(CW\*(C`\-EXIF:CreateDate\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`\-Doc1:XMP:Creator\*(C'\fR), and each group
name may be prefixed by a digit to specify family number (eg.
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-1IPTC:City\*(C'\fR).  Use the \fB\-listg\fR option to list available group names by
family.
.Sp
A special tag name of \f(CW\*(C`All\*(C'\fR may be used to indicate all meta information.
This is particularly useful when a group name is specified to extract all
information in a group (but beware that unless the \fB\-a\fR option is also
used, some tags in the group may be suppressed by same-named tags in other
groups).  The wildcard characters \f(CW\*(C`?\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`*\*(C'\fR may be used in a tag name to
match any single character and zero or more characters respectively.  These
may not be used in a group name, with the exception that a group name of
\&\f(CW\*(C`*\*(C'\fR (or \f(CW\*(C`All\*(C'\fR) may be used to extract all instances of a tag (as if \fB\-a\fR
was used).  Note that arguments containing wildcards must be quoted on the
command line of most systems to prevent shell globbing.
.Sp
A \f(CW\*(C`#\*(C'\fR may be appended to the tag name to disable the print conversion on a
per-tag basis (see the \fB\-n\fR option).  This may also be used when writing or
copying tags.
.Sp
If no tags are specified, all available information is extracted (as if

.IX Item "--TAG"
Exclude specified tag from extracted information.  Same as the \fB\-x\fR option.
Group names and wildcards are permitted as described above for \fB\-TAG\fR. 
Once excluded from the output, a tag may not be re-included by a subsequent
option.  May also be used following a \fB\-tagsFromFile\fR option to exclude
tags from being copied (when redirecting to another tag, it is the source
tag that should be excluded), or to exclude groups from being deleted when
deleting all information (eg. \f(CW\*(C`\-all= \-\-exif:all\*(C'\fR deletes all but \s-1EXIF\s0
information).  But note that this will not exclude individual tags from a
group delete (unless a family 2 group is specified, see note 4 below).
Instead, individual tags may be recovered using the \fB\-tagsFromFile\fR option
(eg. \f(CW\*(C`\-all= \-tagsfromfile @ \-artist\*(C'\fR).

Write a new value for the specified tag (eg. \f(CW\*(C`\-comment=wow\*(C'\fR), or delete the
tag if no \fI\s-1VALUE\s0\fR is given (eg. \f(CW\*(C`\-comment=\*(C'\fR).  \f(CW\*(C`+=\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\-=\*(C'\fR are used to
add or remove existing entries from a list, or to shift date/time values
(see Image::ExifTool::Shift.pl for details).
\&\f(CW\*(C`+=\*(C'\fR may also be used to increment numerical values, and \f(CW\*(C`\-=\*(C'\fR may be used
to conditionally delete or replace a tag (see \*(L"\s-1WRITING EXAMPLES\*(R"\s0 for
examples).
.Sp
\&\fI\s-1TAG\s0\fR may contain one or more leading family 0, 1 or 2 group names,
prefixed by optional family numbers, and separated colons.  If no group name
is specified, the tag is created in the preferred group, and updated in any
other location where a same-named tag already exists.  The preferred group
is the first group in the following list where \fI\s-1TAG\s0\fR is valid: 1) \s-1EXIF, 2\s0)
\&\s-1IPTC, 3\s0) \s-1XMP.\s0
.Sp
The wildcards \f(CW\*(C`*\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`?\*(C'\fR may be used in tag names to assign the same
value to multiple tags.  When specified with wildcards, \*(L"unsafe\*(R" tags are
not written.  A tag name of \f(CW\*(C`All\*(C'\fR is equivalent to \f(CW\*(C`*\*(C'\fR (except that it
doesn't require quoting, while arguments with wildcards do on systems with
shell globbing), and is often used when deleting all metadata (ie. \f(CW\*(C`\-All=\*(C'\fR)
or an entire group (eg. \f(CW\*(C`\-GROUP:All=\*(C'\fR, see note 4 below).  Note that not
all groups are deletable, and that the \s-1JPEG APP14 \s0\*(L"Adobe\*(R" group is not
removed by default with \f(CW\*(C`\-All=\*(C'\fR because it may affect the appearance of the
image.  However, this will remove color space information, so the colors may
be affected (but this may be avoided by copying back the tags defined by the
ColorSpaceTags shortcut).  Use the \fB\-listd\fR option for a complete list of
deletable groups, and see note 5 below regarding the \*(L"\s-1APP\*(R"\s0 groups.  Also,
within an image some groups may be contained within others, and these groups
are removed if the containing group is deleted:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&  JPEG Image:
\&  \- Deleting EXIF or IFD0 also deletes ExifIFD, GlobParamIFD,
\&    GPS, IFD1, InteropIFD, MakerNotes, PrintIM and SubIFD.

\&  \- Deleting Photoshop also deletes IPTC.

.Ve
.Sp
Notes:
.Sp
1) \fBMany tag values may be assigned in a single command\fR.  If two
assignments affect the same tag, the latter takes precedence (except for
list-type tags, for which both values are written).
.Sp
2) In general, MakerNotes tags are considered \*(L"Permanent\*(R", and may be edited
but not created or deleted individually.  This avoids many potential
problems, including the inevitable compatibility problems with \s-1OEM\s0 software
which may be very inflexible about the information it expects to find in the
maker notes.
.Sp
3) Changes to \s-1PDF\s0 files are reversible because the original information is
never actually deleted from the file.  So ExifTool alone may not be used to
securely edit metadata in \s-1PDF\s0 files.
.Sp
4) Specifying \f(CW\*(C`\-GROUP:all=\*(C'\fR deletes the entire group as a block only if a
single family 0 or 1 group is specified.  Otherwise all deletable tags in
the specified group(s) are removed individually, and in this case is it
possible to exclude individual tags from a mass delete.  For example,
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-time:all \-\-Exif:Time:All\*(C'\fR removes all deletable Time tags except those in
the \s-1EXIF. \s0 This difference also applies if family 2 is specified when
deleting all groups. For example, \f(CW\*(C`\-2all:all=\*(C'\fR deletes tags individually,
while \f(CW\*(C`\-all:all=\*(C'\fR deletes entire blocks.
.Sp
5) The \*(L"\s-1APP\*(R"\s0 group names (\*(L"\s-1APP0\*(R"\s0 through \*(L"\s-1APP15\*(R"\s0) are used to delete \s-1JPEG\s0
application segments which are not associated with another deletable group. 
For example, specifying \f(CW\*(C`\-APP14:All=\*(C'\fR will \s-1NOT\s0 delete the \s-1APP14 \s0\*(L"Adobe\*(R"
segment because this is accomplished with \f(CW\*(C`\-Adobe:All\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Special feature:  Integer values may be specified in hexadecimal with a
leading \f(CW\*(C`0x\*(C'\fR, and simple rational values may be specified as fractions.
.IP "\fB\-\fR\fI\s-1TAG\s0\fR<=\fI\s-1DATFILE\s0\fR or \fB\-\fR\fI\s-1TAG\s0\fR<=\fI\s-1FMT\s0\fR" 5
.IX Item "-TAG<=DATFILE or -TAG<=FMT"
Set the value of a tag from the contents of file \fI\s-1DATFILE\s0\fR.  The file name
may also be given by a \fI\s-1FMT\s0\fR string where \f(CW%d\fR, \f(CW%f\fR and \f(CW%e\fR represent the
directory, file name and extension of the original \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR (see the \fB\-w\fR
option for more details).  Note that quotes are required around this
argument to prevent shell redirection since it contains a \f(CW\*(C`<\*(C'\fR symbol.
If \fI\s-1DATFILE\s0\fR/\fI\s-1FMT\s0\fR is not provided, the effect is the same as \f(CW\*(C`\-TAG=\*(C'\fR,
and the tag is simply deleted.  \f(CW\*(C`+<=\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\-<=\*(C'\fR may also be used to
add or delete specific list entries, or to shift date/time values.
.IP "\fB\-tagsFromFile\fR \fI\s-1SRCFILE\s0\fR or \fI\s-1FMT\s0\fR" 5
.IX Item "-tagsFromFile SRCFILE or FMT"
Copy tag values from \fI\s-1SRCFILE\s0\fR to \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR.  Tag names on the command line
after this option specify the tags to be copied, or excluded from the copy.
Wildcards are permitted in these tag names.  If no tags are specified, then
all possible tags (see note 1 below) from the source file are copied to
same-named tags in the preferred location of the output file (the same as
specifying \f(CW\*(C`\-all\*(C'\fR).  More than one \fB\-tagsFromFile\fR option may be used to
copy tags from multiple files.
.Sp
By default, this option will update any existing and writable same-named
tags in the output \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR, but will create new tags only in their preferred
groups.  This allows some information to be automatically transferred to the
appropriate group when copying between images of different formats. However,
if a group name is specified for a tag then the information is written only
to this group (unless redirected to another group, see below).  If \f(CW\*(C`All\*(C'\fR is
used as a group name, then the specified tag(s) are written to the same
family 1 group they had in the source file (ie. the same specific location,
like ExifIFD or XMP-dc).  For example, the common operation of copying all
writable tags to the same specific locations in the output \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR is
achieved by adding \f(CW\*(C`\-all:all\*(C'\fR.  A different family may be specified by
adding a leading family number to the group name (eg. \f(CW\*(C`\-0all:all\*(C'\fR preserves
the same general location, like \s-1EXIF\s0 or \s-1XMP\s0).
.Sp
\&\fI\s-1SRCFILE\s0\fR may be the same as \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR to move information around within a
single file.  In this case, \f(CW\*(C`@\*(C'\fR may be used to represent the source file
(ie. \f(CW\*(C`\-tagsFromFile @\*(C'\fR), permitting this feature to be used for batch
processing multiple files.  Specified tags are then copied from each file in
turn as it is rewritten.  For advanced batch use, the source file name may
also be specified using a \fI\s-1FMT\s0\fR string in which \f(CW%d\fR, \f(CW%f\fR and \f(CW%e\fR represent the
directory, file name and extension of \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR. See \fB\-w\fR option for \fI\s-1FMT\s0\fR
string examples.
.Sp
A powerful redirection feature allows a destination tag to be specified for
each copied tag.  With this feature, information may be written to a tag
with a different name or group.  This is done using
"'\-\fI\s-1DSTTAG\s0\fR<\fI\s-1SRCTAG\s0\fR'\*(L" or 
\&\*(R"'\-\fI\s-1SRCTAG\s0\fR>\fI\s-1DSTTAG\s0\fR'" on the command line after
\&\fB\-tagsFromFile\fR, and causes the value of \fI\s-1SRCTAG\s0\fR to be copied from
\&\fI\s-1SRCFILE\s0\fR and written to \fI\s-1DSTTAG\s0\fR in \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR.  Note that this argument
must be quoted to prevent shell redirection, and there is no \f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR sign as
when assigning new values.  Source and/or destination tags may be prefixed
by a group name and/or suffixed by \f(CW\*(C`#\*(C'\fR.  Wildcards are allowed in both the
source and destination tag names.  A destination group and/or tag name of
\&\f(CW\*(C`All\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`*\*(C'\fR writes to the same family 1 group and/or tag name as the
source.  If no destination group is specified, the information is written to
the preferred group.  Whitespace around the \f(CW\*(C`>\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`<\*(C'\fR is ignored.
As a convenience, \f(CW\*(C`\-tagsFromFile @\*(C'\fR is assumed for any redirected tags
which are specified without a prior \fB\-tagsFromFile\fR option.  Copied tags
may also be added or deleted from a list with arguments of the form
"'\-\fI\s-1SRCTAG\s0\fR+<\fI\s-1DSTTAG\s0\fR'\*(L" or
\&\*(R"'\-\fI\s-1SRCTAG\s0\fR\-<\fI\s-1DSTTAG\s0\fR'".
.Sp
An extension of the redirection feature allows strings involving tag names
to be used on the right hand side of the \f(CW\*(C`<\*(C'\fR symbol with the syntax
"'\-\fI\s-1DSTTAG\s0\fR<\fI\s-1STR\s0\fR'", where tag names in \fI\s-1STR\s0\fR are
prefixed with a \f(CW\*(C`$\*(C'\fR symbol.  See the \fB\-p\fR option for more details about
this syntax.  Strings starting with a \f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR sign must insert a single space
after the \f(CW\*(C`<\*(C'\fR to avoid confusion with the \f(CW\*(C`<=\*(C'\fR operator which sets
the tag value from the contents of a file.  A single space at the start of
the string is removed if it exists, but all other whitespace in the string
is preserved.  See note 8 below about using shortcuts or wildcards with the
redirection feature.
.Sp
See \*(L"\s-1COPYING EXAMPLES\*(R"\s0 for examples using \fB\-tagsFromFile\fR.
.Sp
Notes:
.Sp
1) Some tags (generally tags which may affect the appearance of the image)
are considered \*(L"unsafe\*(R" to write, and are only copied if specified
explicitly (ie. no wildcards).  See the
tag name documentation for more details about
\&\*(L"unsafe\*(R" tags.
.Sp
2) Be aware of the difference between excluding a tag from being copied
(\-\-\fI\s-1TAG\s0\fR), and deleting a tag (\-\fI\s-1TAG\s0\fR=).  Excluding a tag prevents it from
being copied to the destination image, but deleting will remove a
pre-existing tag from the image.
.Sp
3) The maker note information is copied as a block, so it isn't affected
like other information by subsequent tag assignments on the command line.
Also, since the PreviewImage referenced from the maker notes may be rather
large, it is not copied, and must be transferred separately if desired.
.Sp
4) The order of operations is to copy all specified tags at the point of the
\&\fB\-tagsFromFile\fR option in the command line.  Any tag assignment to the
right of the \fB\-tagsFromFile\fR option is made after all tags are copied.  For
example, new tag values are set in the order One, Two, Three then Four with
this command:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    exiftool \-One=1 \-tagsFromFile s.jpg \-Two \-Four=4 \-Three d.jpg
.Ve
.Sp
This is significant in the case where an overlap exists between the copied
and assigned tags because later operations may override earlier ones.
.Sp
5) The normal behaviour of copied tags differs subtly from that of assigned
tags for list-type tags.  When copying to a list, each copied tag overrides
any previous operations on the list.  While this avoids duplicate list items
when copying groups of tags from a file containing redundant information, it
also prevents values of different tags from being copied into the same list
when this is the intent.  So a \fB\-addTagsFromFile\fR option is provided which
allows copying of multiple tags into the same list.  eg)
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    exiftool \-addtagsfromfile @ \*(Aq\-subject<make\*(Aq \*(Aq\-subject<model\*(Aq ...
.Ve
.Sp
Similarly, \fB\-addTagsFromFile\fR must be used when conditionally replacing a
tag to prevent overriding earlier conditions.
.Sp
Other than these differences, the \fB\-tagsFromFile\fR and \fB\-addTagsFromFile\fR
options are equivalent.
.Sp
6) The \fB\-a\fR option (allow duplicate tags) is always in effect when copying
tags from \fI\s-1SRCFILE\s0\fR.
.Sp
7) Structured tags are copied by default when copying tags.  See the
\&\fB\-struct\fR option for details.
.Sp
8) With the redirection feature, copying a tag directly (ie.
"'\-\fI\s-1DSTTAG\s0\fR<\fI\s-1SRCTAG\s0\fR'\*(L") is not the same as interpolating
its value inside a string (ie. \*(R"'\-\fI\s-1DSTTAG\s0\fR<$\fI\s-1SRCTAG\s0\fR'")
for shortcut tags or tag names containing
wildcards.  When copying directly, the values of each matching source tag
are copied individually to the destination tag (as if multiple redirection
arguments were used).  However, when interpolated inside a string, the
values of shortcut tags are concatenated, and wildcards are not allowed.
.IP "\fB\-x\fR \fI\s-1TAG\s0\fR (\fB\-exclude\fR)" 5

between images, but allows the metadata to be altered by editing the
intermediate file (\f(CW\*(C`out.args\*(C'\fR in this example):

.Ve
.Sp
Note:  Be careful when copying information with this technique since it is
easy to write tags which are normally considered \*(L"unsafe\*(R".  For instance,
the FileName and Directory tags are excluded in the example above to avoid
renaming and moving the destination file.  Also note that the second command
above will produce warning messages for any tags which are not writable.
.Sp
As well, the \fB\-sep\fR option should be used when reading back to maintain
separate list items, and the \fB\-struct\fR option may be used when extracting
to preserve structured \s-1XMP\s0 information.
.IP "\fB\-b\fR (\fB\-binary\fR)" 5
.IX Item "-b (-binary)"
Output requested metadata in binary format without tag names or
descriptions.  This option is mainly used for extracting embedded images or
other binary data, but it may also be useful for some text strings since
control characters (such as newlines) are not replaced by '.' as they are in
the default output.  List items are separated by a newline when extracted
with the \fB\-b\fR option.  May be combined with \f(CW\*(C`\-j\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\-php\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\-X\*(C'\fR to

the \f(CW\*(C`printf\*(C'\fR format string.  The specifiers correspond to degrees, minutes
and seconds in that order, but minutes and seconds are optional.  For
example, the following table gives the output for the same coordinate using
various formats:

Notes:
.Sp
1) To avoid loss of precision, the default coordinate format is different
when copying tags using the \fB\-tagsFromFile\fR option.
.Sp
2) If the hemisphere is known, a reference direction (N, S, E or W) is
appended to each printed coordinate, but adding a \f(CW\*(C`+\*(C'\fR to the format
specifier (eg. \f(CW\*(C`%+.6f\*(C'\fR) prints a signed coordinate instead.

Export information in \s-1CSV\s0 format, or import information if \fI\s-1CSVFILE\s0\fR is
specified.  When importing, the \s-1CSV\s0 file must be in exactly the same format
as the exported file.  The first row of the \fI\s-1CSVFILE\s0\fR must be the ExifTool
tag names (with optional group names) for each column of the file, and
values must be separated by commas.  A special \*(L"SourceFile\*(R" column specifies
the files associated with each row of information (and a SourceFile of \*(L"*\*(R"
may be used to define default tags to be imported for all files).  The
following examples demonstrate basic use of this option:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    # generate CSV file with common tags from all images in a directory
\&    exiftool \-common \-csv dir > out.csv
\&

Empty values are ignored when importing.  Also, FileName and Directory
columns are ignored if they exist (ie. ExifTool will not attempt to write
these tags with a \s-1CSV\s0 import).  To force a tag to be deleted, use the \fB\-f\fR
option and set the value to \*(L"\-\*(R" in the \s-1CSV\s0 file (or to the MissingTagValue

the duplicate tags are only included in the \s-1CSV\s0 output if the column
headings are unique.  Adding the \fB\-G4\fR option ensures a unique column
heading for each tag.  When exporting specific tags, the \s-1CSV\s0 columns are
arranged in the same order as the specified tags provided the column
headings exactly match the specified tag names, otherwise the columns are
sorted in alphabetical order.
.Sp
When importing from a \s-1CSV\s0 file, only files specified on the command line are
processed.  Any extra entries in the \s-1CSV\s0 file are ignored.
.Sp
List-type tags are stored as simple strings in a \s-1CSV\s0 file, but the \fB\-sep\fR
option may be used to split them back into separate items when importing.
.Sp
Special feature:  \fB\-csv\fR+=\fI\s-1CSVFILE\s0\fR may be used to add items to existing
lists.  This affects only list-type tags.  Also applies to the \fB\-j\fR option.
.Sp
Note that this option is fundamentally different than all other output
format options because it requires information from all input files to be
buffered in memory before the output is written.  This may result in
excessive memory usage when processing a very large number of files with a
single command.  Also, it makes this option incompatible with the \fB\-w\fR
option.
.IP "\fB\-d\fR \fI\s-1FMT\s0\fR (\fB\-dateFormat\fR)" 5
.IX Item "-d FMT (-dateFormat)"
Set the format for date/time tag values.  The specifics of the \fI\s-1FMT\s0\fR syntax
are system dependent \*(-- consult the \f(CW\*(C`strftime\*(C'\fR man page on your system for
details.  The default format is equivalent to \*(L"%Y:%m:%d \f(CW%H:\fR%M:%S\*(R".  This
option has no effect on date-only or time-only tags and ignores timezone
information if present.  Only one \fB\-d\fR option may be used per command.  The
inverse operation (ie. un-formatting a date/time value) is currently not
applied when writing a date/time tag.
.IP "\fB\-D\fR (\fB\-decimal\fR)" 5
.IX Item "-D (-decimal)"
Show tag \s-1ID\s0 number in decimal when extracting information.
.IP "\fB\-E\fR, \fB\-ex\fR (\fB\-escapeHTML\fR, \fB\-escapeXML\fR)" 5
.IX Item "-E, -ex (-escapeHTML, -escapeXML)"
Escape characters in output values for \s-1HTML \s0(\fB\-E\fR) or \s-1XML \s0(\fB\-ex\fR).  For
\&\s-1HTML,\s0 all characters with Unicode code points above U+007F are escaped as
well as the following 5 characters: & (&amp;) ' (&#39;) " (&quot;)
> (&gt;) and < (&lt;).  For \s-1XML,\s0 only these 5 characters are
escaped.  The \fB\-E\fR option is implied with \fB\-h\fR, and \fB\-ex\fR is implied with
\&\fB\-X\fR.  The inverse conversion is applied when writing tags.
.IP "\fB\-f\fR (\fB\-forcePrint\fR)" 5
.IX Item "-f (-forcePrint)"
Force printing of tags even if their values are not found.  This option only
applies when specific tags are requested on the command line (ie. not with
wildcards or by \f(CW\*(C`\-all\*(C'\fR).  With this option, a dash (\f(CW\*(C`\-\*(C'\fR) is printed for
the value of any missing tag, but the dash may be changed via the \s-1API\s0
MissingTagValue option.  May also be used to add a 'flags' attribute to the
\&\fB\-listx\fR output, or to allow tags to be deleted when writing with the
\&\fB\-csv\fR=\fI\s-1CSVFILE\s0\fR feature.
.IP "\fB\-g\fR[\fI\s-1NUM\s0\fR][:\fI\s-1NUM\s0\fR...] (\fB\-groupHeadings\fR)" 5
.IX Item "-g[NUM][:NUM...] (-groupHeadings)"
Organize output by tag group.  \fI\s-1NUM\s0\fR specifies a group family number, and
may be 0 (general location), 1 (specific location), 2 (category), 3
(document number) or 4 (instance number).  Multiple families may be
specified by separating them with colons.  By default the resulting group
name is simplified by removing any leading \f(CW\*(C`Main:\*(C'\fR and collapsing adjacent
identical group names, but this can be avoided by placing a colon before the
first family number (eg. \fB\-g:3:1\fR).  If \fI\s-1NUM\s0\fR is not specified, \fB\-g0\fR is
assumed.  Use the \fB\-listg\fR option to list group names for a specified
family.
.IP "\fB\-G\fR[\fI\s-1NUM\s0\fR][:\fI\s-1NUM\s0\fR...] (\fB\-groupNames\fR)" 5
.IX Item "-G[NUM][:NUM...] (-groupNames)"
Same as \fB\-g\fR but print group name for each tag.
.IP "\fB\-h\fR (\fB\-htmlFormat\fR)" 5
.IX Item "-h (-htmlFormat)"
Use \s-1HTML\s0 table formatting for output.  Implies the \fB\-E\fR option.  The
formatting options \fB\-D\fR, \fB\-H\fR, \fB\-g\fR, \fB\-G\fR, \fB\-l\fR and \fB\-s\fR may be used
in combination with \fB\-h\fR to influence the \s-1HTML\s0 format.
.IP "\fB\-H\fR (\fB\-hex\fR)" 5
.IX Item "-H (-hex)"
Show tag \s-1ID\s0 number in hexadecimal when extracting information.
.IP "\fB\-htmlDump\fR[\fI\s-1OFFSET\s0\fR]" 5
.IX Item "-htmlDump[OFFSET]"
Generate a dynamic web page containing a hex dump of the \s-1EXIF\s0 information.
This can be a very powerful tool for low-level analysis of \s-1EXIF\s0 information.
The \fB\-htmlDump\fR option is also invoked if the \fB\-v\fR and \fB\-h\fR options are
used together.  The verbose level controls the maximum length of the blocks
dumped.  An \fI\s-1OFFSET\s0\fR may be given to specify the base for displayed
offsets.  If not provided, the \s-1EXIF/TIFF\s0 base offset is used.  Use
\&\fB\-htmlDump0\fR for absolute offsets.  Currently only \s-1EXIF/TIFF\s0 and \s-1JPEG\s0
information is dumped, but the \-u option can be used to give a raw hex dump
of other file formats.
.IP "\fB\-j\fR[=\fI\s-1JSONFILE\s0\fR] (\fB\-json\fR)" 5
.IX Item "-j[=JSONFILE] (-json)"
Use \s-1JSON \s0(JavaScript Object Notation) formatting for console output, or
import \s-1JSON\s0 file if \fI\s-1JSONFILE\s0\fR is specified.  This option may be combined
with \fB\-g\fR to organize the output into objects by group, or \fB\-G\fR to add
group names to each tag.  List-type tags with multiple items are output as
\&\s-1JSON\s0 arrays unless \fB\-sep\fR is used.  By default \s-1XMP\s0 structures are flattened
into individual tags in the \s-1JSON\s0 output, but the original structure may be
preserved with the \fB\-struct\fR option (this also causes all list-type \s-1XMP\s0
tags to be output as \s-1JSON\s0 arrays, otherwise single-item lists are output as
simple strings).  The \fB\-a\fR option is implied if the \fB\-g\fR or \fB\-G\fR options
are used, otherwise it is ignored and duplicate tags are suppressed.  Adding
the \fB\-D\fR or \fB\-H\fR option changes tag values to \s-1JSON\s0 objects with \*(L"val\*(R" and
\&\*(L"id\*(R" fields, and adding \fB\-l\fR adds a \*(L"desc\*(R" field, and a \*(L"num\*(R" field if the
numerical value is different from the converted \*(L"val\*(R".  The \fB\-b\fR option may
be added to output binary data, encoded in base64 if necessary (indicated by
\&\*(L"base64:\*(R" as the first 7 bytes of the value).  The \s-1JSON\s0 output is \s-1UTF\-8\s0
regardless of any \fB\-L\fR or \fB\-charset\fR option setting, but the \s-1UTF\-8\s0
validation is disabled if a character set other than \s-1UTF\-8\s0 is specified.
.Sp
If \fI\s-1JSONFILE\s0\fR is specified, the file is imported and the tag definitions
from the file are used to set tag values on a per-file basis.  The special
\&\*(L"SourceFile\*(R" entry in each \s-1JSON\s0 object associates the information with a
specific target file.  An object with a missing SourceFile or a SourceFile
of \*(L"*\*(R" defines default tags for all target files.  The imported \s-1JSON\s0 file
must have the same format as the exported \s-1JSON\s0 files with the exception that
the \fB\-g\fR option is not compatible with the import file format (use \fB\-G\fR
instead). Additionally, tag names in the input \s-1JSON\s0 file may be suffixed
with a \f(CW\*(C`#\*(C'\fR to disable print conversion.
.Sp
Unlike \s-1CSV\s0 import, empty values are not ignored, and will cause an empty
value to be written if supported by the specific metadata type.  Tags are
deleted by using the \fB\-f\fR option and setting the tag value to \*(L"\-\*(R" (or to
the MissingTagValue setting if this \s-1API\s0 option was used).  Importing with
\&\fB\-j\fR+=\fI\s-1JSONFILE\s0\fR causes new values to be added to existing lists.
.IP "\fB\-l\fR (\fB\-long\fR)" 5
.IX Item "-l (-long)"
Use long 2\-line Canon-style output format.  Adds a description and
unconverted value (if it is different from the converted value) to the \s-1XML,
JSON\s0 or \s-1PHP\s0 output when \fB\-X\fR, \fB\-j\fR or \fB\-php\fR is used.  May also be
combined with \fB\-listf\fR, \fB\-listr\fR or \fB\-listwf\fR to add descriptions of the
file types.
.IP "\fB\-L\fR (\fB\-latin\fR)" 5
.IX Item "-L (-latin)"
Use Windows Latin1 encoding (cp1252) for output tag values instead of the
default \s-1UTF\-8. \s0 When writing, \fB\-L\fR specifies that input text values are
Latin1 instead of \s-1UTF\-8. \s0 Equivalent to \f(CW\*(C`\-charset latin\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-lang\fR [\fI\s-1LANG\s0\fR]" 5
.IX Item "-lang [LANG]"
Set current language for tag descriptions and converted values.  \fI\s-1LANG\s0\fR is
\&\f(CW\*(C`de\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`fr\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`ja\*(C'\fR, etc.  Use \fB\-lang\fR with no other arguments to get a
list of available languages.  The default language is \f(CW\*(C`en\*(C'\fR if \fB\-lang\fR is
not specified.  Note that tag/group names are always English, independent of
the \fB\-lang\fR setting, and translation of warning/error messages has not yet
been implemented.  May also be combined with \fB\-listx\fR to output
descriptions in one language only.
.Sp
By default, ExifTool uses \s-1UTF\-8\s0 encoding for special characters, but the
the \fB\-L\fR or \fB\-charset\fR option may be used to invoke other encodings.
.Sp
Currently, the language support is not complete, but users are welcome to
help improve this by submitting their own translations.  To submit a set of
translations, first use the \fB\-listx\fR option and redirect the output to a
file to generate an \s-1XML\s0 tag database, then add entries for other languages,
zip this file, and email it to phil at owl.phy.queensu.ca for inclusion in
ExifTool.
.IP "\fB\-listItem\fR \fI\s-1INDEX\s0\fR" 5
.IX Item "-listItem INDEX"
For list-type tags, this causes only the item with the specified index to be
extracted.  \fI\s-1INDEX\s0\fR is 0 for the first item in the list.  Negative indices
may also be used to reference items from the end of the list.  Has no effect
on single-valued tags.  Also applies to tag values when copying, and in
\&\fB\-if\fR conditions.
.IP "\fB\-n\fR (\fB\-\-printConv\fR)" 5
.IX Item "-n (--printConv)"
Read and write values as numbers instead of words.  By default, extracted
values are converted to a more human-readable format for printing, but the
\&\fB\-n\fR option disables this print conversion for all tags.  For example:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    > exiftool \-Orientation \-S a.jpg
\&    Orientation: Rotate 90 CW
\&    > exiftool \-Orientation \-S \-n a.jpg
\&    Orientation: 6
.Ve
.Sp
The print conversion may also be disabled on a per-tag basis by suffixing
the tag name with a \f(CW\*(C`#\*(C'\fR character:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    > exiftool \-Orientation# \-Orientation \-S a.jpg
\&    Orientation: 6
\&    Orientation: Rotate 90 CW
.Ve
.Sp
These techniques may also be used to disable the inverse print conversion
when writing.  For example, the following commands all have the same effect:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    > exiftool \-Orientation=\*(AqRotate 90 CW\*(Aq a.jpg
\&    > exiftool \-Orientation=6 \-n a.jpg
\&    > exiftool \-Orientation#=6 a.jpg
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-p\fR \fI\s-1FMTFILE\s0\fR or \fI\s-1STR\s0\fR (\fB\-printFormat\fR)" 5
.IX Item "-p FMTFILE or STR (-printFormat)"
Print output in the format specified by the given file or string (and ignore
other format options).  Tag names in the format file or string begin with a
\&\f(CW\*(C`$\*(C'\fR symbol and may contain a leading group names and/or a trailing \f(CW\*(C`#\*(C'\fR. 
Case is not significant.  Braces \f(CW\*(C`{}\*(C'\fR may be used around the tag name to
separate it from subsequent text.  Use \f(CW$$\fR to represent a \f(CW\*(C`$\*(C'\fR symbol, and
\&\f(CW$/\fR for a newline.  Multiple \fB\-p\fR options may be used, each contributing
a line of text to the output.  Lines beginning with \f(CW\*(C`#[HEAD]\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`#[TAIL]\*(C'\fR are output only for the first and last processed files
respectively.  Lines beginning with \f(CW\*(C`#[BODY]\*(C'\fR and lines not beginning with
\&\f(CW\*(C`#\*(C'\fR are output for each processed file.  Other lines beginning with \f(CW\*(C`#\*(C'\fR
are ignored.  For example, this format file:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&    # this is a comment line
\&    #[HEAD]\-\- Generated by ExifTool $exifToolVersion \-\-
\&    File: $FileName \- $DateTimeOriginal
\&    (f/$Aperture, ${ShutterSpeed}s, ISO $EXIF:ISO)
\&    #[TAIL]\-\- end \-\-
.Ve
.Sp
with this command:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    exiftool \-p test.fmt a.jpg b.jpg
.Ve
.Sp
produces output like this:
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&    \-\- Generated by ExifTool 10.16 \-\-
\&    File: a.jpg \- 2003:10:31 15:44:19
\&    (f/5.6, 1/60s, ISO 100)
\&    File: b.jpg \- 2006:05:23 11:57:38
\&    (f/8.0, 1/13s, ISO 100)
\&    \-\- end \-\-
.Ve
.Sp
When \fB\-ee\fR (\fB\-extractEmbedded\fR) is combined with \fB\-p\fR, embedded documents
are effectively processed as separate input files.
.Sp
If a specified tag does not exist, a minor warning is issued and the line
with the missing tag is not printed.  However, the \fB\-f\fR option may be used
to set the value of missing tags to '\-' (but this may be configured via the
MissingTagValue \s-1API\s0 option), or the \fB\-m\fR option may be used to ignore minor
warnings and leave the missing values empty.
.Sp
An advanced formatting feature allows an arbitrary Perl expression to be
applied to the value of any tag by placing it inside the braces after a
semicolon following the tag name.  The expression has access to the value of
this tag through the default input variable (\f(CW$_\fR), and the full \s-1API\s0
through the current ExifTool object (\f(CW$self\fR).  It may contain any valid
Perl code, including translation (\f(CW\*(C`tr///\*(C'\fR) and substitution (\f(CW\*(C`s///\*(C'\fR)
operations, but note that braces within the expression must be balanced. 
The example below prints the camera Make with spaces translated to
underlines, and multiple consecutive underlines replaced by a single
underline:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    exiftool \-p \*(Aq${make;tr/ /_/;s/_\|_+/_/g}\*(Aq image.jpg
.Ve
.Sp
A default expression of \f(CW\*(C`tr(/\e\e?*:|"<>\e0)()d\*(C'\fR is assumed if the
expression is empty.  This removes the characters / \e ? * : | < >
and null from the printed value.  (These characters are illegal in Windows
file names, so this feature is useful if tag values are used in file names.)
.IP "\fB\-php\fR" 5
.IX Item "-php"
Format output as a \s-1PHP\s0 Array.  The \fB\-g\fR, \fB\-G\fR, \fB\-D\fR, \fB\-H\fR, \fB\-l\fR,
\&\fB\-sep\fR and \fB\-struct\fR options combine with \fB\-php\fR, and duplicate tags are
handled in the same way as with the \fB\-json\fR option.  As well, the \fB\-b\fR
option may be added to output binary data.  Here is a simple example showing
how this could be used in a \s-1PHP\s0 script:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    <?php
\&    eval(\*(Aq$array=\*(Aq . \`exiftool \-php \-q image.jpg\`);
\&    print_r($array);
\&    ?>
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-s\fR[\fI\s-1NUM\s0\fR] (\fB\-short\fR)" 5
.IX Item "-s[NUM] (-short)"
Short output format.  Prints tag names instead of descriptions.  Add \fI\s-1NUM\s0\fR
or up to 3 \fB\-s\fR options for even shorter formats:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    \-s1 or \-s        \- print tag names instead of descriptions
\&    \-s2 or \-s \-s     \- no extra spaces to column\-align values
\&    \-s3 or \-s \-s \-s  \- print values only (no tag names)
.Ve
.Sp
Also effective when combined with \fB\-t\fR, \fB\-h\fR, \fB\-X\fR or \fB\-listx\fR options.
.IP "\fB\-S\fR (\fB\-veryShort\fR)" 5
.IX Item "-S (-veryShort)"
Very short format.  The same as \fB\-s2\fR or two \fB\-s\fR options.  Tag names are
printed instead of descriptions, and no extra spaces are added to
column-align values.
.IP "\fB\-sep\fR \fI\s-1STR\s0\fR (\fB\-separator\fR)" 5
.IX Item "-sep STR (-separator)"
Specify separator string for items in list-type tags.  When reading, the
default is to join list items with \*(L", \*(R".  When writing, this option causes
values assigned to list-type tags to be split into individual items at each
substring matching \fI\s-1STR\s0\fR (otherwise they are not split by default).  Space
characters in \fI\s-1STR\s0\fR match zero or more whitespace characters in the value.
.Sp
Note that an empty separator ("") is allowed, and will join items with no
separator when reading, or split the value into individual characters when
writing.
.IP "\fB\-sort\fR, \fB\-\-sort\fR" 5
.IX Item "-sort, --sort"
Sort output by tag description, or by tag name if the \fB\-s\fR option is used.
When sorting by description, the sort order will depend on the \fB\-lang\fR
option setting.  Without the \fB\-sort\fR option, tags appear in the order they
were specified on the command line, or if not specified, the order they were
extracted from the file.  By default, tags are organized by groups when
combined with the \fB\-g\fR or \fB\-G\fR option, but this grouping may be disabled
with \fB\-\-sort\fR.
.IP "\fB\-struct\fR, \fB\-\-struct\fR" 5
.IX Item "-struct, --struct"
Output structured \s-1XMP\s0 information instead of flattening to individual tags.
This option works well when combined with the \s-1XML \s0(\fB\-X\fR) and \s-1JSON \s0(\fB\-j\fR)
output formats.  For other output formats, the structures are serialized
into the same format as when writing structured information (see
<http://owl.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/struct.html> for details).  When
copying, structured tags are copied by default unless \fB\-\-struct\fR is used to
disable this feature (although flattened tags may still be copied by
specifying them individually unless \fB\-struct\fR is used).  These options have
no effect when assigning new values since both flattened and structured tags
may always be used when writing.
.IP "\fB\-t\fR (\fB\-tab\fR)" 5
.IX Item "-t (-tab)"
Output a tab-delimited list of description/values (useful for database
import).  May be combined with \fB\-s\fR to print tag names instead of
descriptions, or \fB\-S\fR to print tag values only, tab-delimited on a single
line.  The \fB\-t\fR option may also be used to add tag table information to the
\&\fB\-X\fR option output.
.IP "\fB\-T\fR (\fB\-table\fR)" 5
.IX Item "-T (-table)"
Output tag values in table form.  Equivalent to \fB\-t \-S \-q \-f\fR.
.IP "\fB\-v\fR[\fI\s-1NUM\s0\fR] (\fB\-verbose\fR)" 5
.IX Item "-v[NUM] (-verbose)"
Print verbose messages.  \fI\s-1NUM\s0\fR specifies the level of verbosity in the
range 0\-5, with higher numbers being more verbose.  If \fI\s-1NUM\s0\fR is not given,
then each \fB\-v\fR option increases the level of verbosity by 1.  With any
level greater than 0, most other options are ignored and normal console
output is suppressed unless specific tags are extracted.  Using \fB\-v0\fR
causes the console output buffer to be flushed after each line (which may be
useful to avoid delays when piping exiftool output), and prints the name of
each processed file when writing.  Also see the \fB\-progress\fR option.
.IP "\fB\-w\fR[+|!] \fI\s-1EXT\s0\fR or \fI\s-1FMT\s0\fR (\fB\-textOut\fR)" 5
.IX Item "-w[+|!] EXT or FMT (-textOut)"
Write console output to files with names ending in \fI\s-1EXT\s0\fR, one for each
source file.  The output file name is obtained by replacing the source file
extension (including the '.') with the specified extension (and a '.' is
added to the start of \fI\s-1EXT\s0\fR if it doesn't already contain one).
Alternatively, a \fI\s-1FMT\s0\fR string may be used to give more control over the
output file name and directory.  In the format string, \f(CW%d\fR, \f(CW%f\fR and \f(CW%e\fR
represent the directory, filename and extension of the source file, and \f(CW%c\fR
represents a copy number which is automatically incremented if the file
already exists.  \f(CW%d\fR includes the trailing '/' if necessary, but \f(CW%e\fR does not
include the leading '.'.  For example:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    \-w %d%f.txt       # same effect as "\-w txt"
\&    \-w dir/%f_%e.out  # write files to "dir" as "FILE_EXT.out"
\&    \-w dir2/%d%f.txt  # write to "dir2", keeping dir structure
\&    \-w a%c.txt        # write to "a.txt" or "a1.txt" or "a2.txt"...
.Ve
.Sp
Existing files will not be overwritten unless an exclamation point is added
to the option name (ie. \fB\-w!\fR or \fB\-textOut!\fR), or a plus sign to append to
the existing file (ie. \fB\-w+\fR or \fB\-textOut+\fR).  Both may be used (ie.
\&\fB\-w+!\fR or \fB\-textOut+!\fR) to overwrite output files that didn't exist before
the command was run, and append the output from multiple source files.  For
example, to write one output file for all source files in each directory:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    exiftool \-filename \-createdate \-T \-w+! %d/out.txt \-r DIR
.Ve
.Sp
Capitalized format codes \f(CW%D\fR, \f(CW%F\fR, \f(CW%E\fR and \f(CW%C\fR provide slightly different
alternatives to the lower case versions.  \f(CW%D\fR does not include the trailing
\&'/', \f(CW%F\fR is the full filename including extension, \f(CW%E\fR includes the leading
\&'.', and \f(CW%C\fR increments the count for each processed file (see below).
.Sp
Notes:
.Sp
1) In a Windows \s-1BAT\s0 file the \f(CW\*(C`%\*(C'\fR character is represented by \f(CW\*(C`%%\*(C'\fR, so an
argument like \f(CW\*(C`%d%f.txt\*(C'\fR is written as \f(CW\*(C`%%d%%f.txt\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
2) If the argument for \fB\-w\fR does not contain a valid format code (eg. \f(CW%f\fR),
then it is interpreted as a file extension.  It is not possible to specify a
simple filename as an argument \*(-- creating a single output file from
multiple source files is typically done by shell redirection, ie)
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    exiftool FILE1 FILE2 ... > out.txt
.Ve
.Sp
But if necessary, an empty format code may be used to force the argument to
be interpreted as a format string, and the same result may be obtained
without the use of shell redirection:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    exiftool \-w+! %0fout.txt FILE1 FILE2 ...
.Ve
.Sp
Advanced features:
.Sp
A substring of the original file name, directory or extension may be taken
by specifying a field width immediately following the '%' character.  If the
width is negative, the substring is taken from the end.  The substring
position (characters to ignore at the start or end of the string) may be
given by a second optional value after a decimal point.  For example:
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&    Input File Name     Format Specifier    Output File Name
\&    \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-    \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-    \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-
\&    Picture\-123.jpg     %7f.txt             Picture.txt
\&    Picture\-123.jpg     %\-.4f.out           Picture.out
\&    Picture\-123.jpg     %7f.%\-3f            Picture.123
\&    Picture\-123a.jpg    Meta%\-3.1f.txt      Meta123.txt
.Ve
.Sp
For \f(CW%d\fR and \f(CW%D\fR, the field width/position specifiers may be applied to the
directory levels instead of substring position by using a colon instead of a
decimal point in the format specifier.  For example:
.Sp

For \f(CW%c\fR, these modifiers have a different effects.  If a field width is
given, the copy number is padded with zeros to the specified width.  A
leading '\-' adds a dash before the copy number, and a '+' adds an underline.
By default, the copy number is omitted from the first file of a given name,
but this can be changed by adding a decimal point to the modifier.  For
example:

A special feature allows the copy number to be incremented for each
processed file by using \f(CW%C\fR (upper case) instead of \f(CW%c\fR.  This allows a
sequential number to be added to output file names, even if the names are
different.  For \f(CW%C\fR, a copy number of zero is not omitted as it is with \f(CW%c\fR. 
The number before the decimal place gives the starting index, the number
after the decimal place gives the field width.  The following examples show
the output filenames when used with the command
\&\f(CW\*(C`exiftool rose.jpg star.jpg jet.jpg ...\*(C'\fR:

All format codes may be modified by 'l' or 'u' to specify lower or upper
case respectively (ie. \f(CW%le\fR for a lower case file extension).  When used
to modify \f(CW%c\fR or \f(CW%C\fR, the numbers are changed to an alphabetical base (see
example H above).  Also, \f(CW%c\fR may be modified by 'n' to count using natural
numbers starting from 1, instead of 0 (see example F above).
.Sp
This same \fI\s-1FMT\s0\fR syntax is used with the \fB\-o\fR and \fB\-tagsFromFile\fR options,
although \f(CW%c\fR is only valid for output file names.
.IP "\fB\-W\fR[!|+] \fI\s-1FMT\s0\fR (\fB\-tagOut\fR)" 5
.IX Item "-W[!|+] FMT (-tagOut)"
This enhanced version of the \fB\-w\fR option allows a separate output file to
be created for each extracted tag.  The differences between \fB\-W\fR and \fB\-w\fR
are as follows:
.Sp
1) With \fB\-W\fR, a new output file is created for each extracted tag.
.Sp
2) \fB\-W\fR supports three additional format codes:  \f(CW%t\fR, \f(CW%g\fR and \f(CW%s\fR represent
the tag name, group name, and suggested extension for the output file (based
on the format of the data).  The \f(CW%g\fR code may be followed by a single digit
to specify the group family number (eg. \f(CW%g1\fR), otherwise family 0 is assumed.
The substring width/position/case specifiers may be used with these format
codes in exactly the same way as with \f(CW%f\fR and \f(CW%e\fR.
.Sp
3) The argument for \fB\-W\fR is interpreted as a file name if it contains no
format codes.  (For \fB\-w\fR, this would be a file extension.)  This change
allows a simple file name to be specified, which, when combined with the
append feature, provides a method to write metadata from multiple source
files to a single output file without the need for shell redirection.
.Sp
4) Adding the \fB\-v\fR option to \fB\-W\fR generates a list of the tags and output
file names instead of giving a verbose dump of the entire file.  (Unless
appending all output to one file for each source file by using \fB\-W+\fR with
an output file \fI\s-1FMT\s0\fR that does not contain \f(CW%t\fR, \f(CW$g\fR or \f(CW%s\fR.)
.Sp
5) Individual list items are stored in separate files when \fB\-W\fR is combined
with \fB\-b\fR, but note that for separate files to be created \f(CW%c\fR must be used
in \fI\s-1FMT\s0\fR to give the files unique names.
.IP "\fB\-Wext\fR \fI\s-1EXT\s0\fR, \fB\-\-Wext\fR \fI\s-1EXT\s0\fR (\fB\-tagOutExt\fR)" 5
.IX Item "-Wext EXT, --Wext EXT (-tagOutExt)"
This option is used to specify the type of output file(s) written by the
\&\fB\-W\fR option.  An output file is written only if the suggested extension
matches \fI\s-1EXT\s0\fR.  Multiple \fB\-Wext\fR options may be used to write more than
one type of file.  Use \fB\-\-Wext\fR to write all but the specified type(s).
.IP "\fB\-X\fR (\fB\-xmlFormat\fR)" 5
.IX Item "-X (-xmlFormat)"
Use ExifTool-specific \s-1RDF/XML\s0 formatting for console output.  Implies the
\&\fB\-a\fR option, so duplicate tags are extracted.  The formatting options
\&\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-D\fR, \fB\-H\fR, \fB\-l\fR, \fB\-s\fR, \fB\-sep\fR, \fB\-struct\fR and \fB\-t\fR may be used
in combination with \fB\-X\fR to affect the output, but note that the tag \s-1ID
\&\s0(\fB\-D\fR, \fB\-H\fR and \fB\-t\fR), binary data (\fB\-b\fR) and structured output
(\fB\-struct\fR) options are not effective for the short output (\fB\-s\fR). Another
restriction of \fB\-s\fR is that only one tag with a given group and name may
appear in the output.  Note that the tag \s-1ID\s0 options (\fB\-D\fR, \fB\-H\fR and \fB\-t\fR)
will produce non-standard \s-1RDF/XML\s0 unless the \fB\-l\fR option is also used.
.Sp
By default, \fB\-X\fR outputs flattened tags, so \fB\-struct\fR should be added if
required to preserve \s-1XMP\s0 structures.  List-type tags with multiple values
are formatted as an \s-1RDF\s0 Bag, but they are combined into a single string when
\&\fB\-s\fR or \fB\-sep\fR is used.  Using \fB\-L\fR changes the \s-1XML\s0 encoding from \*(L"\s-1UTF\-8\*(R"\s0
to \*(L"windows\-1252\*(R".  Other \fB\-charset\fR settings change the encoding only if
there is a corresponding standard \s-1XML\s0 character set.  The \fB\-b\fR option
causes binary data values to be written, encoded in base64 if necessary. 
The \fB\-t\fR option adds tag table information to the output (table \f(CW\*(C`name\*(C'\fR,
decimal tag \f(CW\*(C`id\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`index\*(C'\fR for cases where multiple conditional tags
exist with the same \s-1ID\s0).
.Sp
Note: This output is \s-1NOT\s0 the same as \s-1XMP\s0 because it uses
dynamically-generated property names corresponding to the ExifTool tag
names, and not the standard \s-1XMP\s0 properties.  To write \s-1XMP\s0 instead, use the
\&\fB\-o\fR option with an \s-1XMP\s0 extension for the output file.

in \s-1JPEG\s0 and \s-1MPO\s0 files, streaming metadata in \s-1AVCHD\s0 videos, and the resource
fork of Mac \s-1OS\s0 files.  Implies the \fB\-a\fR option.  Use \fB\-g3\fR or \fB\-G3\fR to
identify the originating document for extracted information. Embedded
documents containing sub-documents are indicated with dashes in the family 3
group name.  (eg. \f(CW\*(C`Doc2\-3\*(C'\fR is the 3rd sub-document of the 2nd embedded
document.) Note that this option may increase processing time substantially,
especially for \s-1PDF\s0 files with many embedded images.

.IX Item "-ext EXT, --ext EXT (-extension)"
Process only files with (\fB\-ext\fR) or without (\fB\-\-ext\fR) a specified
extension.  There may be multiple \fB\-ext\fR and \fB\-\-ext\fR options.  \s-1EXT\s0 may
begin with a leading '.', and case is not significant.  \f(CW"*"\fR may be used
to process files with any extension (or none at all), as in the last three
examples:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&    exiftool \-ext .JPG DIR            # process only JPG files
\&    exiftool \-\-ext cr2 \-\-ext dng DIR  # supported files but CR2/DNG
\&    exiftool \-ext "*" DIR             # process all files
\&    exiftool \-ext "*" \-\-ext xml DIR   # process all but XML files
\&    exiftool \-ext "*" \-\-ext . DIR     # all but those with no ext
.Ve
.Sp
Using this option has two main advantages over specifying \f(CW\*(C`*.\f(CIEXT\f(CW\*(C'\fR on the
command line:  1) It applies to files in subdirectories when combined with
the \fB\-r\fR option.  2) The \fB\-ext\fR option is case-insensitive, which is
useful when processing files on case-sensitive filesystems.
.IP "\fB\-F\fR[\fI\s-1OFFSET\s0\fR] (\fB\-fixBase\fR)" 5
.IX Item "-F[OFFSET] (-fixBase)"
Fix the base for maker notes offsets.  A common problem with some image
editors is that offsets in the maker notes are not adjusted properly when
the file is modified.  This may cause the wrong values to be extracted for
some maker note entries when reading the edited file.  This option allows an
integer \fI\s-1OFFSET\s0\fR to be specified for adjusting the maker notes base offset.
If no \fI\s-1OFFSET\s0\fR is given, ExifTool takes its best guess at the correct base.
Note that exiftool will automatically fix the offsets for images which store
original offset information (eg. newer Canon models).  Offsets are fixed
permanently if \fB\-F\fR is used when writing \s-1EXIF\s0 to an image. eg)

.IP "\fB\-fast\fR[\fI\s-1NUM\s0\fR]" 5

Increase speed of extracting information from \s-1JPEG\s0 images.  With this
option, ExifTool will not scan to the end of a \s-1JPEG\s0 image to check for an
\&\s-1AFCP\s0 or PreviewImage trailer, or past the first comment in \s-1GIF\s0 images or the
audio/video data in \s-1WAV/AVI\s0 files to search for additional metadata.  These
speed benefits are small when reading images directly from disk, but can be
substantial if piping images through a network connection.  For more
substantial speed benefits, \fB\-fast2\fR also causes exiftool to avoid
extracting any \s-1EXIF\s0 MakerNote information.  \fB\-fast3\fR avoids processing the
file entirely, and returns only an initial guess at FileType and the pseudo
System tags.
.IP "\fB\-fileOrder\fR [\-]\fI\s-1TAG\s0\fR" 5
.IX Item "-fileOrder [-]TAG"
Set file processing order according to the sorted value of the specified
\&\fI\s-1TAG\s0\fR.  For example, to process files in order of date:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    exiftool \-fileOrder DateTimeOriginal DIR
.Ve
.Sp
Additional \fB\-fileOrder\fR options may be added for secondary sort keys. 
Numbers are sorted numerically, and all other values are sorted
alphabetically.  The sort order may be reversed by prefixing the tag name
with a \f(CW\*(C`\-\*(C'\fR (eg. \f(CW\*(C`\-fileOrder \-createdate\*(C'\fR).  Print conversion of the sorted
values is disabled with the \fB\-n\fR option, or a \f(CW\*(C`#\*(C'\fR appended to the tag
name.  Other formatting options (eg. \fB\-d\fR) have no effect on the sorted
values.  Note that the \fB\-fileOrder\fR option has a large performance impact
since it involves an additional processing pass of each file.
.IP "\fB\-i\fR \fI\s-1DIR\s0\fR (\fB\-ignore\fR)" 5
.IX Item "-i DIR (-ignore)"
Ignore specified directory name.  \fI\s-1DIR\s0\fR may be either an individual folder
name, or a full path.  If a full path is specified, it must match the
Directory tag exactly to be ignored.  Use multiple \fB\-i\fR options to ignore
more than one directory name.  A special \fI\s-1DIR\s0\fR value of \f(CW\*(C`SYMLINKS\*(C'\fR (case
sensitive) may be specified to ignore symbolic links when the \fB\-r\fR option
is used.
.IP "\fB\-if\fR \fI\s-1EXPR\s0\fR" 5
.IX Item "-if EXPR"
Specify a condition to be evaluated before processing each \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR.  \fI\s-1EXPR\s0\fR
is a Perl-like logic expression containing tag names prefixed by \f(CW\*(C`$\*(C'\fR
symbols.  It is evaluated with the tags from each \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR in turn, and the
file is processed only if the expression returns true.  Unlike Perl variable
names, tag names are not case sensitive and may contain a hyphen.  As well,
tag names may have a leading group names separated by colons, and/or a
trailing \f(CW\*(C`#\*(C'\fR character to disable print conversion.  The expression
\&\f(CW$GROUP:all\fR evaluates to 1 if any tag exists in the specified \f(CW\*(C`GROUP\*(C'\fR, or
0 otherwise (see note 2 below).  When multiple \fB\-if\fR options are used, all
conditions must be satisfied to process the file.  Returns an exit status of
1 if all files fail the condition.  Below are a few examples:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    # extract shutterspeed from all Canon images in a directory
\&    exiftool \-shutterspeed \-if \*(Aq$make eq "Canon"\*(Aq dir
\&
\&    # add one hour to all images created on or after Apr. 2, 2006
\&    exiftool \-alldates+=1 \-if \*(Aq$CreateDate ge "2006:04:02"\*(Aq dir
\&
\&    # set EXIF ISO value if possible, unless it is set already
\&    exiftool \*(Aq\-exif:iso<iso\*(Aq \-if \*(Aqnot $exif:iso\*(Aq dir
\&
\&    # find images containing a specific keyword (case insensitive)
\&    exiftool \-if \*(Aq$keywords =~ /harvey/i\*(Aq \-filename dir
.Ve
.Sp
Notes:
.Sp
1) The \fB\-n\fR and \fB\-b\fR options also apply to tags used in \fI\s-1EXPR\s0\fR.
.Sp
2) Some binary data blocks are not extracted unless specified explicitly.
These tags are not available for use in the \fB\-if\fR condition unless they are
also specified on the command line.  The alternative is to use the
\&\f(CW$GROUP:all\fR syntax. (eg. Use \f(CW$exif:all\fR instead of \f(CW$exif\fR in \fI\s-1EXPR\s0\fR
to test for the existence of \s-1EXIF\s0 tags.)
.Sp
3) Tags in the string are interpolated the same way as with \fB\-p\fR before the
expression is evaluated.  In this interpolation, \f(CW$/\fR is converted to a
newline and \f(CW$$\fR represents a single \f(CW\*(C`$\*(C'\fR symbol (so Perl variables, if
used, require a double \f(CW\*(C`$\*(C'\fR).
.Sp
4) The condition may only test tags from the file being processed.  To
process one file based on tags from another, two steps are required.  For
example, to process \s-1XMP\s0 sidecar files in directory \f(CW\*(C`DIR\*(C'\fR based on tags from
the associated \s-1NEF:\s0
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    exiftool \-if EXPR \-p \*(Aq$directory/$filename\*(Aq \-ext nef DIR > nef.txt
\&    exiftool \-@ nef.txt \-srcfile %d%f.xmp ...
.Ve
.Sp
5) The \fB\-a\fR option has no effect on the evaluation of the expression, and
the values of duplicate tags are accessible only by specifying a group name
(such as a family 4 instance number, eg. \f(CW$Copy1:TAG\fR, \f(CW$Copy2:TAG\fR, etc).
.IP "\fB\-m\fR (\fB\-ignoreMinorErrors\fR)" 5
.IX Item "-m (-ignoreMinorErrors)"
Ignore minor errors and warnings.  This enables writing to files with minor
errors and disables some validation checks which could result in minor
warnings.  Generally, minor errors/warnings indicate a problem which usually
won't result in loss of metadata if ignored.  However, there are exceptions,
so ExifTool leaves it up to you to make the final decision.  Minor errors
and warnings are indicated by \*(L"[minor]\*(R" at the start of the message. 
Warnings which affect processing when ignored are indicated by \*(L"[Minor]\*(R"
(with a capital \*(L"M\*(R").
.IP "\fB\-o\fR \fI\s-1OUTFILE\s0\fR or \fI\s-1FMT\s0\fR (\fB\-out\fR)" 5
.IX Item "-o OUTFILE or FMT (-out)"
Set the output file or directory name when writing information.  Without
this option, when any \*(L"real\*(R" tags are written the original file is renamed
to \f(CW\*(C`FILE_original\*(C'\fR and output is written to \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR.  When writing only
FileName and/or Directory \*(L"pseudo\*(R" tags, \fB\-o\fR causes the file to be copied
instead of moved, but directories specified for either of these tags take
precedence over that specified by the \fB\-o\fR option.
.Sp
\&\fI\s-1OUTFILE\s0\fR may be \f(CW\*(C`\-\*(C'\fR to write to stdout.  The output file name may also be
specified using a \fI\s-1FMT\s0\fR string in which \f(CW%d\fR, \f(CW%f\fR and \f(CW%e\fR represent the
directory, file name and extension of \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR.  Also, \f(CW%c\fR may be used to add
a copy number. See the \fB\-w\fR option for \fI\s-1FMT\s0\fR string examples.
.Sp
The output file is taken to be a directory name if it already exists as a
directory or if the name ends with '/'.  Output directories are created if
necessary.  Existing files will not be overwritten.  Combining the
\&\fB\-overwrite_original\fR option with \fB\-o\fR causes the original source file to
be erased after the output file is successfully written.
.Sp
A special feature of this option allows the creation of certain types of
files from scratch, or with the metadata from another type of file.  The
following file types may be created using this technique:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    XMP, EXIF, EXV, MIE, ICC/ICM, VRD, DR4
.Ve
.Sp
The output file type is determined by the extension of \fI\s-1OUTFILE\s0\fR (specified
as \f(CW\*(C`\-.EXT\*(C'\fR when writing to stdout).  The output file is then created from a
combination of information in \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR (as if the \fB\-tagsFromFile\fR option was
used), and tag values assigned on the command line.  If no \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR is
specified, the output file may be created from scratch using only tags
assigned on the command line.
.IP "\fB\-overwrite_original\fR" 5
.IX Item "-overwrite_original"
Overwrite the original \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR (instead of preserving it by adding
\&\f(CW\*(C`_original\*(C'\fR to the file name) when writing information to an image.
Caution: This option should only be used if you already have separate backup
copies of your image files.  The overwrite is implemented by renaming a
temporary file to replace the original.  This deletes the original file and
replaces it with the edited version in a single operation.  When combined
with \fB\-o\fR, this option causes the original file to be deleted if the output
file was successfully written (ie. the file is moved instead of copied).
.IP "\fB\-overwrite_original_in_place\fR" 5
.IX Item "-overwrite_original_in_place"
Similar to \fB\-overwrite_original\fR except that an extra step is added to
allow the original file attributes to be preserved.  For example, on a Mac
this causes the original file creation date, type, creator, label color,
icon, Finder tags and hard links to the file to be preserved (but note that
the Mac \s-1OS\s0 resource fork is always preserved unless specifically deleted
with \f(CW\*(C`\-rsrc:all=\*(C'\fR).  This is implemented by opening the original file in
update mode and replacing its data with a copy of a temporary file before
deleting the temporary.  The extra step results in slower performance, so
the \fB\-overwrite_original\fR option should be used instead unless necessary.
.IP "\fB\-P\fR (\fB\-preserve\fR)" 5
.IX Item "-P (-preserve)"
Preserve the filesystem modification date/time of the original file
(\f(CW\*(C`FileModifyDate\*(C'\fR) when writing.  Note that some filesystems store a
creation date  (\f(CW\*(C`FileCreateDate\*(C'\fR) which is not affected by this option. 
This creation date is preserved only on Windows systems where Win32API::File
and Win32::API are available.  For other systems, the
\&\fB\-overwrite_original_in_place\fR option may be used if necessary to preserve
the creation date.  This option is superseded by writing FileModifyDate (and
FileCreateDate) manually.
.IP "\fB\-password\fR \fI\s-1PASSWD\s0\fR" 5
.IX Item "-password PASSWD"
Specify password to allow processing of password-protected \s-1PDF\s0 documents. 
If a password is required but not given, a warning is issued and the
document is not processed.  This option is ignored if a password is not
required.
.IP "\fB\-progress\fR" 5
.IX Item "-progress"
Show file progress count in messages.  The progress count appears in
brackets after the name of each processed file, and gives the current file
number and the total number of files to be processed.  Implies the \fB\-v0\fR
option, which prints the name of each processed file when writing.  When
combined with the \fB\-if\fR option, the total count includes all files before
the condition is applied, but files that fail the condition will not have
their names printed.
.IP "\fB\-q\fR (\fB\-quiet\fR)" 5
.IX Item "-q (-quiet)"
Quiet processing.  One \fB\-q\fR suppresses normal informational messages, and a
second \fB\-q\fR suppresses warnings as well.  Error messages can not be
suppressed, although minor errors may be downgraded to warnings with the
\&\fB\-m\fR option, which may then be suppressed with \f(CW\*(C`\-q \-q\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-r\fR[.] (\fB\-recurse\fR)" 5
.IX Item "-r[.] (-recurse)"
Recursively process files in subdirectories.  Only meaningful if \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR is
a directory name.  Subdirectories with names beginning with \*(L".\*(R" are not
processed unless \*(L".\*(R" is added to the option name (ie. \fB\-r.\fR or
\&\fB\-recurse.\fR).  By default, exiftool will also follow symbolic links to
directories if supported by the system, but this may be disabled with \f(CW\*(C`\-i
SYMLINKS\*(C'\fR (see the \fB\-i\fR option for details).
.IP "\fB\-scanForXMP\fR" 5
.IX Item "-scanForXMP"
Scan all files (even unsupported formats) for \s-1XMP\s0 information unless found
already.  When combined with the \fB\-fast\fR option, only unsupported file
types are scanned.  Warning: It can be time consuming to scan large files.
.IP "\fB\-u\fR (\fB\-unknown\fR)" 5
.IX Item "-u (-unknown)"
Extract values of unknown tags.  Add another \fB\-u\fR to also extract unknown
information from binary data blocks.  This option applies to tags with
numerical tag \s-1ID\s0's, and causes tag names like \*(L"Exif_0xc5d9\*(R" to be generated
for unknown information.  It has no effect on information types which have

When combined with \fB\-listx\fR, the \fB\-s\fR option shortens the output by
omitting the descriptions and values (as in the last example above), and
\&\fB\-f\fR adds a 'flags' attribute if applicable.  The flags are formatted as a

.IX Item "-geotag TRKFILE"
Geotag images from the specified \s-1GPS\s0 track log file.  Using the \fB\-geotag\fR
option is equivalent to writing a value to the \f(CW\*(C`Geotag\*(C'\fR tag.  After the
\&\fB\-geotag\fR option has been specified, the value of the \f(CW\*(C`Geotime\*(C'\fR tag is
written to define a date/time for the position interpolation.  If \f(CW\*(C`Geotime\*(C'\fR
is not specified, the value is copied from \f(CW\*(C`DateTimeOriginal\*(C'\fR.  For
example, the following two commands are equivalent:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    exiftool \-geotag track.log image.jpg
\&    exiftool \-geotag "\-Geotime<DateTimeOriginal" image.jpg
.Ve
.Sp
When the \f(CW\*(C`Geotime\*(C'\fR value is converted to \s-1UTC,\s0 the local system timezone is
assumed unless the date/time value contains a timezone.  Writing \f(CW\*(C`Geotime\*(C'\fR
causes the following tags to be written (provided they can be calculated
from the track log, and they are supported by the destination metadata
format):  GPSLatitude, GPSLatitudeRef, GPSLongitude, GPSLongitudeRef,
GPSAltitude, GPSAltitudeRef, GPSDateStamp, GPSTimeStamp, GPSDateTime,
GPSTrack, GPSTrackRef, GPSSpeed, GPSSpeedRef, GPSImgDirection,
GPSImgDirectionRef, GPSPitch and GPSRoll.  By default, tags are created in
\&\s-1EXIF,\s0 and updated in \s-1XMP\s0 only if they already exist.  However,
\&\f(CW\*(C`EXIF:Geotime\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`XMP:Geotime\*(C'\fR may be specified to write only \s-1EXIF\s0 or \s-1XMP\s0
tags respectively.  Note that GPSPitch and GPSRoll are non-standard, and
require user-defined tags in order to be written.
.Sp
The \f(CW\*(C`Geosync\*(C'\fR tag may be used to specify a time correction which is applied
to each \f(CW\*(C`Geotime\*(C'\fR value for synchronization with \s-1GPS\s0 time.  For example,
the following command compensates for image times which are 1 minute and 20
seconds behind \s-1GPS:\s0
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    exiftool \-geosync=+1:20 \-geotag a.log DIR
.Ve
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`Geosync\*(C'\fR must be set before \f(CW\*(C`Geotime\*(C'\fR (if specified) to be effective.
Advanced \f(CW\*(C`Geosync\*(C'\fR features allow a linear time drift correction and
synchronization from previously geotagged images.  See \*(L"geotag.html\*(R" in the
full ExifTool distribution for more information.
.Sp
Multiple \fB\-geotag\fR options may be used to concatinate \s-1GPS\s0 track log data.
Also, a single \fB\-geotag\fR option may be used to load multiple track log
files by using wildcards in the \fI\s-1TRKFILE\s0\fR name, but note that in this case
\&\fI\s-1TRKFILE\s0\fR must be quoted on most systems (with the notable exception of
Windows) to prevent filename expansion.  For example:
.Sp
.Vb 1

These utility options automate the maintenance of the \f(CW\*(C`_original\*(C'\fR files
created by exiftool.  They have no effect on files without an \f(CW\*(C`_original\*(C'\fR
copy.  The \fB\-restore_original\fR option restores the specified files from
their original copies by renaming the \f(CW\*(C`_original\*(C'\fR files to replace the

.Sp
.Vb 1

The \fB\-delete_original\fR option deletes the \f(CW\*(C`_original\*(C'\fR copies of all files
specified on the command line.  Without a trailing \f(CW\*(C`!\*(C'\fR this option prompts

processing related preview images or sidecar files.  See the \fB\-w\fR option
for a description of the \fI\s-1FMT\s0\fR syntax.  Note that file name \fI\s-1FMT\s0\fR strings
for all options are based on the original \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR specified from the command
line, not the name of the source file specified by \fB\-srcfile\fR.
.Sp
For example, to copy metadata from \s-1NEF\s0 files to the corresponding \s-1JPG\s0
previews in a directory where other \s-1JPG\s0 images may exist:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    exiftool \-ext nef \-tagsfromfile @ \-srcfile %d%f.jpg dir

.Sp
If than one \fB\-srcfile\fR option is specified, the files are tested in order
and the first existing source file is processed.  If none of the source
files already exist, then exiftool uses the first \fB\-srcfile\fR specified.
.Sp
A \fI\s-1FMT\s0\fR of \f(CW\*(C`@\*(C'\fR may be used to represent the original \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR, which may be
useful when specifying multiple \fB\-srcfile\fR options (eg. to fall back to

.IP "\fB\-stay_open\fR \fI\s-1FLAG\s0\fR" 5
.IX Item "-stay_open FLAG"
If \fI\s-1FLAG\s0\fR is \f(CW1\fR or \f(CW\*(C`True\*(C'\fR, causes exiftool keep reading from the \fB\-@\fR
\&\fI\s-1ARGFILE\s0\fR even after reaching the end of file.  This feature allows calling
applications to pre-load exiftool, thus avoiding the overhead of loading
exiftool for each command.  The procedure is as follows:
.Sp
1) Execute \f(CW\*(C`exiftool \-stay_open True \-@ \f(CIARGFILE\f(CW\*(C'\fR, where \fI\s-1ARGFILE\s0\fR is the
name of an existing (possibly empty) argument file or \f(CW\*(C`\-\*(C'\fR to pipe arguments
from the standard input.
.Sp
2) Write exiftool command-line arguments to \fI\s-1ARGFILE\s0\fR, one argument per
line (see the \fB\-@\fR option for details).
.Sp
3) Write \f(CW\*(C`\-execute\en\*(C'\fR to \fI\s-1ARGFILE\s0\fR, where \f(CW\*(C`\en\*(C'\fR represents a newline
sequence.  (Note: You may need to flush your write buffers here if using
buffered output.)  Exiftool will then execute the command with the arguments
received up to this point, send a \*(L"{ready}\*(R" message to stdout when done
(unless the \fB\-q\fR or \fB\-T\fR option is used), and continue trying to read
arguments for the next command from \fI\s-1ARGFILE\s0\fR.  To aid in command/response
synchronization, any number appended to the \f(CW\*(C`\-execute\*(C'\fR option is echoed in
the \*(L"{ready}\*(R" message.  For example, \f(CW\*(C`\-execute613\*(C'\fR results in \*(L"{ready613}\*(R".
.Sp
4) Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each command.
.Sp
5) Write \f(CW\*(C`\-stay_open\enFalse\en\*(C'\fR to \fI\s-1ARGFILE\s0\fR when done.  This will cause
exiftool to process any remaining command-line arguments then exit normally.
.Sp
The input \fI\s-1ARGFILE\s0\fR may be changed at any time before step 5 above by
writing the following lines to the currently open \fI\s-1ARGFILE\s0\fR:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    \-stay_open
\&    True
\&    \-@
\&    NEWARGFILE
.Ve
.Sp
This causes \fI\s-1ARGFILE\s0\fR to be closed, and \fI\s-1NEWARGFILE\s0\fR to be kept open.
(Without the \fB\-stay_open\fR here, exiftool would have returned to reading
arguments from \fI\s-1ARGFILE\s0\fR after reaching the end of \fI\s-1NEWARGFILE\s0\fR.)
.Sp
Note:  When writing arguments to a disk file there is a delay of up to 0.01
seconds after writing \f(CW\*(C`\-execute\en\*(C'\fR before exiftool starts processing the
command.  This delay may be avoided by sending a \s-1CONT\s0 signal to the exiftool
process immediately after writing \f(CW\*(C`\-execute\en\*(C'\fR.  (There is no associated
delay when writing arguments via a pipe with \f(CW\*(C`\-@ \-\*(C'\fR, so the signal is not
necessary when using this technique.)

.SH "WINDOWS UNICODE FILE NAMES"
.IX Header "WINDOWS UNICODE FILE NAMES"
In Windows, by default, file and directory names are specified on the
command line (or in arg files) using the system code page, which varies with
the system settings.  Unfortunately, these code pages are not complete
character sets, so not all file names may be represented.
.PP
ExifTool 9.79 and later allow the file name encoding to be specified with
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-charset filename=CHARSET\*(C'\fR, where \f(CW\*(C`CHARSET\*(C'\fR is the name of a valid
ExifTool character set, preferably \f(CW\*(C`UTF8\*(C'\fR (see the \fB\-charset\fR option for a
complete list).  Setting this triggers the use of Windows wide-character i/o
routines, thus providing support for all Unicode file names.  But note that
it is not trivial to pass properly encoded file names on the Windows command
line (see <http://owl.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/faq.html#Q18> for
details), so placing them in a \s-1UTF\-8\s0 encoded \fB\-@\fR argfile is recommended if
possible.
.PP
When a directory name is provided, the file name encoding need not be
specified (unless the directory name contains special characters), and
ExifTool will automatically use wide-character routines to scan the
directory.
.PP
The filename character set applies to the \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR arguments as well as
filename arguments of \fB\-@\fR, \fB\-geotag\fR, \fB\-o\fR, \fB\-p\fR, \fB\-srcfile\fR,
\&\fB\-tagsFromFile\fR, \fB\-csv\fR=, \fB\-j\fR= and \fB\-\fR\fI\s-1TAG\s0\fR<=.  However, it does
not apply to the \fB\-config\fR filename, which always uses the system character
set.  The \f(CW\*(C`\-charset filename=\*(C'\fR option must come before the \fB\-@\fR option to
be effective, but the order doesn't matter with respect to other options.
.PP
Notes:
.PP
1) FileName and Directory tag values still use the same encoding as other
tag values, and are converted to/from the filename character set when
writing/reading if specified.
.PP
2) Unicode support is not yet implemented for other Windows-based systems
like Cygwin.

.SH "RENAMING EXAMPLES"
.IX Header "RENAMING EXAMPLES"
By writing the \f(CW\*(C`FileName\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`Directory\*(C'\fR tags, files are renamed and/or
moved to new directories.  This can be particularly useful and powerful for
organizing files by date when combined with the \fB\-d\fR option.  New
directories are created as necessary, but existing files will not be
overwritten.  The format codes \f(CW%d\fR, \f(CW%f\fR and \f(CW%e\fR may be used in the new file
name to represent the directory, name and extension of the original file,
and \f(CW%c\fR may be used to add a copy number if the file already exists (see the
\&\fB\-w\fR option for details).  Note that if used within a date format string,
an extra '%' must be added to pass these codes through the date/time parser.
(And further note that in a Windows batch file, all '%' characters must also
be escaped, so in this extreme case '%%%%f' is necessary to pass a simple
\&'%f' through the two levels of parsing.)  See

.IX Item "exiftool '-FileName<CreateDate' -d %Y%m%d_%H%M%S%%-c.%%e dir"
Rename all images in \f(CW\*(C`dir\*(C'\fR according to the \f(CW\*(C`CreateDate\*(C'\fR date and time,
adding a copy number with leading '\-' if the file already exists (\f(CW\*(C`%\-c\*(C'\fR),
and preserving the original file extension (\f(CW%e\fR).  Note the extra '%'
necessary to escape the filename codes (\f(CW%c\fR and \f(CW%e\fR) in the date format
string.
.ie n .IP "exiftool \-r '\-FileName<CreateDate' \-d %Y\-%m\-%d/%H%M_%%f.%%e dir" 5

.IX Item "exiftool -r '-FileName<CreateDate' -d %Y-%m-%d/%H%M_%%f.%%e dir"
Both the directory and the filename may be changed together via the
\&\f(CW\*(C`FileName\*(C'\fR tag if the new \f(CW\*(C`FileName\*(C'\fR contains a '/'.  The example above
recursively renames all images in a directory by adding a \f(CW\*(C`CreateDate\*(C'\fR
timestamp to the start of the filename, then moves them into new directories
named by date.
.ie n .IP "exiftool '\-FileName<${CreateDate}_$filenumber.jpg' \-d %Y%m%d \-ext jpg ." 5
.el .IP "exiftool '\-FileName<${CreateDate}_$filenumber.jpg' \-d \f(CW%Y\fR%m%d \-ext jpg ." 5
.IX Item "exiftool '-FileName<${CreateDate}_$filenumber.jpg' -d %Y%m%d -ext jpg ."
Set the filename of all \s-1JPG\s0 images in the current directory from the
CreateDate and FileNumber tags, in the form \*(L"20060507_118\-1861.jpg\*(R".
.SH "GEOTAGGING EXAMPLES"
.IX Header "GEOTAGGING EXAMPLES"
ExifTool implements geotagging via 3 special tags: Geotag (which for
convenience is also implemented as an exiftool option), Geosync and Geotime.
The examples below highlight some geotagging features.  See
<http://owl.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/geotag.html> for additional
documentation.
.IP "exiftool \-geotag track.log a.jpg" 5
.IX Item "exiftool -geotag track.log a.jpg"
Geotag an image (\f(CW\*(C`a.jpg\*(C'\fR) from position information in a \s-1GPS\s0 track log
(\f(CW\*(C`track.log\*(C'\fR).  Since the \f(CW\*(C`Geotime\*(C'\fR tag is not specified, the value of
DateTimeOriginal is used for geotagging.  Local system time is assumed
unless DateTimeOriginal contains a timezone.
.IP "exiftool \-geotag t.log \-geotime='2009:04:02 13:41:12\-05:00' a.jpg" 5
.IX Item "exiftool -geotag t.log -geotime='2009:04:02 13:41:12-05:00' a.jpg"
Geotag an image with the \s-1GPS\s0 position for a specific time.  (Note that the
\&\f(CW\*(C`Geotag\*(C'\fR tag must be assigned before \f(CW\*(C`Geotime\*(C'\fR for the \s-1GPS\s0 data to be
available when \f(CW\*(C`Geotime\*(C'\fR is set.)
.IP "exiftool \-geotag log.gpx '\-xmp:geotime<createdate' dir" 5
.IX Item "exiftool -geotag log.gpx '-xmp:geotime<createdate' dir"
Geotag all images in directory \f(CW\*(C`dir\*(C'\fR with \s-1XMP\s0 tags instead of \s-1EXIF\s0 tags,
based on the image CreateDate.  (In this case, the order of the arguments
doesn't matter because tags with values copied from other tags are always
set after constant values.)
.IP "exiftool \-geotag a.log \-geosync=\-20 dir" 5
.IX Item "exiftool -geotag a.log -geosync=-20 dir"
Geotag images in directory \f(CW\*(C`dir\*(C'\fR, accounting for image timestamps which
were 20 seconds ahead of \s-1GPS.\s0
.IP "exiftool \-geotag a.log \-geosync=1.jpg \-geosync=2.jpg dir" 5
.IX Item "exiftool -geotag a.log -geosync=1.jpg -geosync=2.jpg dir"
Geotag images using time synchronization from two previously geotagged images
(1.jpg and 2.jpg), synchronizing the image and \s-1GPS\s0 times using a linear time
drift correction.
.IP "exiftool \-geotag a.log '\-geotime<${createdate}+01:00' dir" 5
.IX Item "exiftool -geotag a.log '-geotime<${createdate}+01:00' dir"
Geotag images in \f(CW\*(C`dir\*(C'\fR using CreateDate with the specified timezone.  If
CreateDate already contained a timezone, then the timezone specified on the
command line is ignored.
.IP "exiftool \-geotag= a.jpg" 5
.IX Item "exiftool -geotag= a.jpg"
Delete \s-1GPS\s0 tags which may have been added by the geotag feature.  Note that
this does not remove all \s-1GPS\s0 tags \*(-- to do this instead use \f(CW\*(C`\-gps:all=\*(C'\fR.
.IP "exiftool \-xmp:geotag= a.jpg" 5
.IX Item "exiftool -xmp:geotag= a.jpg"
Delete \s-1XMP GPS\s0 tags which were added by the geotag feature.
.IP "exiftool \-xmp:geotag=track.log a.jpg" 5
.IX Item "exiftool -xmp:geotag=track.log a.jpg"
Geotag an image with \s-1XMP\s0 tags, using the time from DateTimeOriginal.
.IP "exiftool \-geotag a.log \-geotag b.log \-r dir" 5
.IX Item "exiftool -geotag a.log -geotag b.log -r dir"
Combine multiple track logs and geotag an entire directory tree of images.
.IP "exiftool \-geotag 'tracks/*.log' \-r dir" 5
.IX Item "exiftool -geotag 'tracks/*.log' -r dir"
Read all track logs from the \f(CW\*(C`tracks\*(C'\fR directory.
.ie n .IP "exiftool \-p gpx.fmt \-d %Y\-%m\-%dT%H:%M:%SZ dir > out.gpx" 5
.el .IP "exiftool \-p gpx.fmt \-d \f(CW%Y\fR\-%m\-%dT%H:%M:%SZ dir > out.gpx" 5
.IX Item "exiftool -p gpx.fmt -d %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ dir > out.gpx"
Generate a \s-1GPX\s0 track log from all images in directory \f(CW\*(C`dir\*(C'\fR.  This example
uses the \f(CW\*(C`gpx.fmt\*(C'\fR file included in the full ExifTool distribution package
and assumes that the images in \f(CW\*(C`dir\*(C'\fR have all been previously geotagged.
.SH "PIPING EXAMPLES"
.IX Header "PIPING EXAMPLES"
.IP "cat a.jpg | exiftool \-" 5
.IX Item "cat a.jpg | exiftool -"
Extract information from stdin.
.IP "exiftool image.jpg \-thumbnailimage \-b | exiftool \-" 5
.IX Item "exiftool image.jpg -thumbnailimage -b | exiftool -"
Extract information from an embedded thumbnail image.
.IP "cat a.jpg | exiftool \-iptc:keywords+=fantastic \- > b.jpg" 5
.IX Item "cat a.jpg | exiftool -iptc:keywords+=fantastic - > b.jpg"
Add an \s-1IPTC\s0 keyword in a pipeline, saving output to a new file.
.IP "curl \-s http://a.domain.com/bigfile.jpg | exiftool \-fast \-" 5
.IX Item "curl -s http://a.domain.com/bigfile.jpg | exiftool -fast -"
Extract information from an image over the internet using the cURL utility. 
The \fB\-fast\fR option prevents exiftool from scanning for trailer information,
so only the meta information header is transferred.
.IP "exiftool a.jpg \-thumbnailimage \-b | exiftool \-comment=wow \- | exiftool a.jpg \-thumbnailimage'<=\-'" 5
.IX Item "exiftool a.jpg -thumbnailimage -b | exiftool -comment=wow - | exiftool a.jpg -thumbnailimage'<=-'"
Add a comment to an embedded thumbnail image.  (Why anyone would want to do
this I don't know, but I've included this as an example to illustrate the
flexibility of ExifTool.)
.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
.IX Header "DIAGNOSTICS"
The exiftool application exits with a status of 0 on success, or 1 if an
error occurred or if all files failed the \fB\-if\fR condition (for any of the
commands if \fB\-execute\fR was used).
